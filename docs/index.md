## Background 
loxilb started as a project to ease deployments of cloud-native/kubernetes workloads for the edge. When we deploy services in public clouds like AWS/GCP, the services becomes easily accessible or exported to the outside world. The public cloud providers, usually by default, associate load-balancer instances for incoming requests to these services to ensure everything is quite smooth. 

However, for on-prem and edge deployments, there is no *service type - external load balancer* provider by default. For a long time, **MetalLB** originating from Google was the only choice for the needy. But edge services are a different ball game altogether due to the fact that there are so many exotic protocols in play like GTP, SCTP, SRv6 etc and integrating everything into a seamlessly working solution has been quite difficult.

loxilb dev team was approached by many people who wanted to solve this problem. As a first step to solve the problem, it became apparent that networking stack provided by Linux kernel, although very solid,  really lacked the development process agility to quickly provide support for a wide variety of permutations and combinations of protocols and stateful load-balancing on them. Our search led us to the awesome tech developed by the Linux community - eBPF. The flexibility to introduce new functionality into the OS Kernel as a safe sandbox program was a complete fit to our design philosophy. It also does not need any dedicated CPU cores which makes it perfect for designing energy-efficient edge architectures.   

## What is loxilb

loxilb is an open source hyper-scale software load-balancer for cloud-native workloads. It uses eBPF as its core-engine and is based on Golang. It is designed to power on-premise, edge and public-cloud Kubernetes cluster deployments.   

###  ðŸš€ loxilb aims to provide the following :   
- Service type load-balancer for kubernetes    
    * L4/NAT stateful loadbalancer    
    * NAT44, NAT66, NAT64 with One-ARM, FullNAT, DSR etc    
    * Support for TCP, UDP, SCTP (w/ multi-homing), FTP, TFTP etc    
    * High-availability support with hitless/maglev clustering    
    * Full compliance for K8s loadbalancer Spec    
    * Multi-cluster support       
-  Extensive and scalable liveness probes for cloud-native environments    
-  High-perf replacement for the *aging* iptables/ipvs    
-  L7 proxy support    
-  Telco/5G/6G friendly features    
    * GTP tunnels as first class citizens     
    * Optimized SRv6 implementation    
    * Support for UL-CL with LB, QFI and other utility extensions    

### ðŸ§¿ loxilb is composed of:        
- Bespoke GoLang based control plane components     
- [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) based data-path forwarding    
   * Home-grown stack with advanced features like [Conntrack](https://thermalcircle.de/doku.php?id=blog:linux:connection_tracking_1_modules_and_hooks), QoS etc    
   * Complete kernel networking bypass    
   * Highly scalable with low-latency & high-throughput    
- GoLang powered easy to use APIs/Interfaces/CLI infra    
- Seamless integration with goBGP based routing stack    

### ðŸ“¦ Why choose loxilb?    
   
- ```Performs``` much better compared to its competitors across various architectures    
    * [Single-Node Performance](https://loxilb-io.github.io/loxilbdocs/perf-single/)    
    * [Multi-Node Performance](https://loxilb-io.github.io/loxilbdocs/perf-multi/)    
    * [Performance on ARM](https://www.loxilb.io/post/running-loxilb-on-aws-graviton2-based-ec2-instance)    
    * [Short Demo on Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJXcM0x6IeQ)    
- ebpf makes it ```flexible``` and ```future-proof``` (kernel version agnostic and in future OS agnostic ðŸš§)      
- Advanced quality of service for workloads (per LB, per end-point or per client)       
- Includes powerful NG ```stateful firewalling``` and ```IPSEC/Wireguard``` support      
- Optimized/Custom end-point ```liveness checks at scale```      
- Support for ```5G/Edge```  cloud-native workloads     
- Works with ```any``` Kubernetes distribution/CNI - k8s/k3s/k0s/kind/OpenShift + Calico/Flannel/Cilium/Weave/Multus etc      
- Extensive support for ```SCTP workloads``` (with multi-homing) on k8s    
- Dual stack with ```NAT66, NAT64``` support for k8s     
- k8s ```multi-cluster``` support ðŸš§      
- Runs in ```any``` cloud : public cloud (EKS), on-prem or multi-cloud environments        

  (*ðŸš§: *Work in progress*)
